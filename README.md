Got it. You want to create a **Nepali children’s educational short video platform** that can be monetized across social media. Let’s break this down step by step, including content ideas, monetization strategies, branding, and a complete roadmap. I’ll also suggest some brand names suitable for your audience.

---

## **1. Brand Name Suggestions**

A brand name for children’s education content should be **catchy, easy to remember, and kid-friendly**. Here are some options:

* **Sikshya Fun** – “Education + Fun”
* **Chhimeki Kids** – “Neighborhood kids” (friendly & local vibe)
* **Bachha Bytes** – “Short educational bites for kids”
* **GyaanGhar** – “House of knowledge”
* **NepaKids** – Short, local identity, clear audience
* **Mero Sikshya** – “My learning” in Nepali, relatable

My top recommendation: **Bachha Bytes** – it’s short, modern, and explains exactly what the content is.

---

## **2. Content Ideas**

You need short, engaging videos for children (30–90 seconds) that **teach while entertaining**. Example topics:

* **Alphabet & Numbers** – Nepali letters, English alphabet, counting
* **Colors & Shapes** – Basic visual learning
* **Stories & Fables** – Moral lessons in short animations or narrated stories
* **Science Experiments** – Simple, safe, fun experiments at home
* **Fun Facts** – Animals, planets, nature, Nepal-specific knowledge
* **Language Skills** – English/Nepali vocabulary for kids
* **Songs & Rhymes** – Educational rhymes and songs

**Tip:** Kids love **bright colors, animations, fun characters, and repetition**.
